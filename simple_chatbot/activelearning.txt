Active Learning (subset of machine learning) is a kind of query-based learning where
the user queries for specific information based on certain region of intrest.

The fundamental assumption behind the active learning algorithm concept is that an ML 
algorithm could potentially reach ahigher level of accuracy while using a smaller 
number of training labels if it were allowed to choose the data it wants to learn 
from.

Building CB based on AL 
Instead of storing each instance in the memory the learner can exploit from the 
hypothesis postulated by AL that user has the liberty to choose the data to learn 
from specific to the learning algorithm.
So in comparision to regular ML algorithms where we randomly picked up the 
instances we can apply AL to do it smartly in an interactive approach.


examples of AL
a. Speech recognition: Accurate labeling of speech utterances is time consuming 
and requires expertise, annotation at word level can take ten times longer than 
actual audio, and annotating phonemes can take 400 times as long.

b. Document classification and filtering: Learning to classify documents or any 
kind of media requires that users label each document or media file with particular 
labels, like relevant or irrelavant.
